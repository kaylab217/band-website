      Maria-Cecilia Simone Kelly, known professionally as Rico Nasty, is an
      American rapper, singer, and songwriter from Maryland. She rose to

    <h1>Why Rico</h1>
    <p>
      She actually came up with her stage name in high school, when a kid made a
      joke about how she smelled. At the time, she was wearing a Puerto Rico
      lanyard (her mother is Puerto Rican) and the boy called her “Rico nasty.”
      She liked the moniker so much, it stuck.
